# Self-Paced Training Content
### xtUML Project Design Note


1. Abstract
-----------
As part of a larger strategy to improve the available xtUML education a
set of online, self-paced training materials are prepared.  These materials
will be open, accessible, extensible, growing, indexed and searchable.
A starting outline of the materials is presented here.

3. Background
-------------
The world expects to learn how to use engineering development tools online
and on the terms of the user.  "Show me."  In 2014, the most common medium
has become video stored and indexed on YouTube.
